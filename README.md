# Hive Projects
List of (most of) the projects I worked on at hive

>[!NOTE]
>Hive has specific, strict rules that you must follow.<br/><br/>
Most notably, **If you want to use something from the C standard libary, you have to make it yourself - with exceptions depending on the project.** These restrictions are lighter for C++ projects, but are in full force for C.<br><br>
Formatting of the code is also very limited, for example: **80 char row width, 25 rows per function, 5 functions per file.**
